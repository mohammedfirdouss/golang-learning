## Loops in Go

Go provides a single looping construct: the `for` loop. 

## My Points:
1. **Basic For Loop**: Iterates with an initializer, condition, and post statement.
2. **Infinite Loop**: A `for` loop without conditions runs indefinitely.
3. **Continue Statement**: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one.

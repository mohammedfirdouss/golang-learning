# Golang Learning

Okay, so first off, you might ask **why Golang**? I’ve been reading into the history of the language itself, and one thing that resonated with me was this: 

> *Its designers were primarily motivated by their shared dislike of C++.*  
> [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))  
> [Criticism of C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_C%2B%2B)

C++ is a great language, don’t get me wrong, but I share some of the criticisms that many developers also have.

I have little knowledge of Go, but I want to improve that during this break. Continious learning is the key to many things really.

I plan to focus more on **Golang** during this break heading towards the new year. My learning goals include:

- [x] **Basics**
- [x] **Variables**
- **Arrays**  
- **Loops**  
- **If-Else Statements**  
- [x] **Functions**
- **Maps**  
- [x] **Structs**
- [x] **Errors**
- **Packages and Modules**
- **Concurrency (Goroutines and Channels)**
- [x] **Interfaces**
- **GoRoutines and Channels**
- **Go Tools and Best Practices**
  

Additionally, I’ll likely read more articles and videos as I go.
